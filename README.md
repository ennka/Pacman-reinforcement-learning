# Pacman-reinforcement-learning

This project is the course project of UC Berkeley, Compsci 188.
---------------------------------------------------------------

In this project, we are required to use value iteration and Q-learning (or approximate Q-learning)

I first test the result on grid world, then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.
